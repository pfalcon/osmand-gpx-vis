This is intended to be set of tools to help to do reporting and visualizations
of OsmAnd (http://osmand.net/) tracks, possibly with added Audio/Video/Picture
notes.

Requirements:
1. Support well-known non-OpenSource tools:

1.1. Allow to create KML file for import into Google Maps, so link to a user
map can be passed to selected 3rd parties, with map showing track, locations
of a/v notes taken, and allows to browse a note by just clicking on it. To
achieve the latter, media content would be hosted on 3rd party media sharing
site, with Dropbox being immediate target (more choices - better).
1.2. Allow to create KML file for usage with Google Earth and thus allowing
for more detailed exploration of track and note waypoints. Media content
is still hosted on 3rd party sharing site.
1.3. Allow to create self-contained KMZ file with all the media, so it can
be browsed without relying on 3rd party for media hosting and without relying
on Internet connection availability.

2. Support OpenSource tools:

2.1. Use OpenStreetMap instead of Google Maps for mash-ups (see 1.1)
2.2. Use JOSM/Marble/WorldWind/whatver instead of Google Earth.
2.3. Support OwnCloud for media hosting.
